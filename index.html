        <p>Hi there!<br/> 
            We are a group of people with a great passion for video games and we’ve just started working on a new project called Numia.</p>

    <div class="HomeContentDiv">
        <h2>About Numia</h2>
        <p>Numia is a music-based adventure game set into an imaginary world with music at its core. The game features an innovative system for touch gesture recognition through which the player can play music in an intuitive way.</p>

        <h2>Our Plan</h2>
        <p>In the course of the next few months we’re eager to work collaboratively in order to develop a demo of the game. Once we have a solid game prototype, we’ll look for a way to fund the project (such as kickstarter, looking for publisher, etc…).</p>

    <div class="HomeContentDiv">
        <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
        <p>We are currently exploring, developing and testing few ideas related to all the core gameplay and design aspects of the game.
            Using this modular approach, we can focus on a particular functionality/feature at a time and then eventually combining the pieces together into the final game prototype.
        </p>

        <h2>Things That Inspire Us</h2>
        <p>We are a huge fun of Jenova Chen’s game design. For us games are more than just mere entertainment, they are powerful communication means through which people can learn and feel.
