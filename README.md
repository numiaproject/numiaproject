Hi there!

We are a group of people with a great passion for video games and we’ve just started working on a new project called **Numia**.<br/><br/>

### About Numia<br/>
Numia is a music-based adventure game set into an imaginary world with music at its core. 
The game features an innovative system for touch gesture recognition through which the player can play music in an intuitive way.<br/><br/>

### About Us<br/>
We are an inclusive group, eager to work with like-minded people and create something special together. Within our group there is no strict hierarchy but everyone’s opinion counts. We value above all proactivity, dedication and mutual respect. 
The team will potentially include the most diverse range of talents, from story tellers to programmers, from graphic designers to sound designers. 
Therefore, whatever is your field and expertise, if you are a dedicated person willing to take new exciting risks feel free to drop us an email at numiaproject@gmail.com. 
_Join us, have fun and be creative_!<br/><br/>

### Our Plan<br/>
In the course of the next few months we’re eager to work collaboratively in order to develop a demo of the game. Once we have a solid game prototype, we’ll look for a way to fund the project (such as kickstarter, looking for publisher, etc…).<br/><br/>

### Where We Are Now<br/>
We are currently exploring, developing and testing few ideas related to all the core gameplay and design aspects of the game.<br/>
Using this modular approach, we can focus on a particular functionality/feature at a time 
and then eventually combining the pieces together into the final game prototype.<br/><br/>

### What Inspire Us<br/>
We are a huge fun of Jenova Chen’s game design. 
For us games are more than just mere entertainment, they are powerful communication means through which people can learn and feel.<br/><br/>
